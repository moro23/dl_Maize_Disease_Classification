## Porject Title: 
Maize Disease Classification

## Problem Statement
Maize crop over the years has been used as a staple crop in Ghana. The ability to grow the maize plant across the predominantly four agro-ecological zones namely; Coastal Savannah zone, Forest zone, Transition zone and Guinea Savannah zone. An estimated amount of 50% of all cereal produced in Ghana is made up of maize. The growing challenge of early identification and treatment of maize disease is hampering crop yields. The effects of these diseases on the quality of grains is increasing and its overall potential to wipe out entire hectares of crop yield can contribute to major losses to the farmer and lead to general food insecurity. Current disease diagnostics techniques which require expert skills and which is also time consuming in terms of analyzing affected plants, understanding the symptoms, identifying the disease, and also suggesting suitable remedies. The limitations of such techniques has necessitated the need to introduce other alternative techniques in the identification and classification of diseases at an early stage. The application of deep learning techniques such as the Convolutional neural network (CNN) which in recent years have shown great results in identifying and classifying similar patterns in the area of research. We propose the use of CNNs and transfer learning techniques to identify and classify maize plant disease in terms of prediction accuracy. 

## Goal
To train an ANN to classify three type of maize diseases. Namely:
- Maize Ear Rot
- Maize Fall armyworm
- Maize Stem Borer.
